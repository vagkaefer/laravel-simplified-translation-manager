# Laravel Simplified Translation Manager

Laravel offers a robust solution for managing multiple languages. However, as the project scales, incorporating numerous languages and developers, managing translations can become intricate, leading to occasional lapses in translations variables across files.

The solution to this issue lies within this package. It mandates that developers add new translation variables solely in English (en) language. Once this is done, the package takes over, processing all languages and making appropriate adjustments to all variables. This streamlines the translation process and ensures consistency across all language files.

In addition, there are also additional settings, such as adding Suffixes or Prefixes to variables without translation, to help identify them.
